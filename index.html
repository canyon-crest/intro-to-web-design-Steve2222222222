        <h3>Workout</h3>
    <p><img src="images/climbing.jpg" id="climbingpic">My parents tell me many stories of when I was young, but one really stuck out to me. Apparently I had been a slow learner to walk, being slightly behind other kids my age when one day I stood up and instead of learning to slowly walk, I had advanced to a sprint and would run around anywhere while other kids were stuck walking. Ever since then I would constantly run around, tiring out my parents. I believe this is when I started my love for exercise where I could not stop moving around. I tried out many different sports ranging from ball sports, racket sports, to running, but nothing could fit the thrill that I had yearned for. Then I found climbing. The first time I tried climbing, it was not what I expected. A hard workout on the body that felt more like a fun pastime like a trampoline park than a sport. But after moving to <span class="highlight">San Diego</span>, I found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_climbing" target="_blank">climbing</a> could be the sport that I was searching for. </p>

        <h3>Robotics</h3>
    <p><img src="images/frc.jpg" id="frcpic">Ever since I was able to get into the robotics team on the team, I had a very fun time spending time with new people. We built a whole robot from scratch based on the new game and from there, spent the season refining and visiting different competitions with hopes to get to <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2025/cmptx" target="_blank">worlds</a> in <span class="highlight">Texas</span>. Thankfully we were able to get to worlds and from there I had the greatest experience I have ever had with games in hotels, pool hangouts, and watching the competition between teams all around the world. I daydream back to these days whenever I'm bored and they instantly bring me back to the fun I had.</p>

        <h3>Addiction</h3>
    <p><img src="images/dopamine.jpg" id="dopaminepic">As I look back I realized I have been spoiled as a child, leading me to being addicted to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dopamine#:~:text=Dopamine%20is%20known%20as%20the,%2C%20learning%2C%20and%20emotional%20responses." target="_blank">dopamine</a> since a child even before tiktok and instagram were a thing in my life. This had led to some unhealthy addictions but thankfully I was able to fix these addictions by finding friends that I could hang out with without having to be online to have fun. Hanging out with my friends during weekends and breaks were always fun, talking and playing with each other. I also found ways to exhaust my body in order to occupy my time such as exercising or reading. By finding these activities to replace my dopamine <span class="highlight">addiction</span>, I was able to enjoy living in the moment rather than having to depend on technology to rule my life.</p>
